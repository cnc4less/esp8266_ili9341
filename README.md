@par Description
  * ESP8266 support libraries
    * All of the code in this project, except where noted is written by me
    * Analog Devices ADF4351 Wideband Synthesizer driver and test code
      * Control is via serial terminal that works while the other demos run
      * adf4351 123456000 10000
        * frequency, and channel spacing used in calculations
      * adf4351_scan 144e6 145e6 10000
        * start frequency, end frequency, channel spacing
    * ILI9341 display driver 
      * Mutiple custom size window support
      * Window scrolling 
      * readPixel() function suported
      * The specific display this was tested on is a TM022HDH26 display I got from ebay.
      * Not limited by ILI9341 hardware scroll restrictions.
   * BDF compiler and fonts - creates C code used in the display drivers
   * Wireframe Viewer 
     * Code generator for Earth coastline data
     * I created two wireframe demos 
       * Cube wireframe dataset
       * Earth coastline dataset - wireframe view still needs hidden line removal option
   * CORDIC C code generator and 3D transformation code support functions use by wireframe viewer code
   * Small PRINTF with full floating point support - much smaller then GNU full verson along 
   * ATOF and various integer conversions
   * WEB server using SD CARD with CGI processing - files and CGI results can be ANY SIZE!
    * Example web site for testing
    * WEB server can update TFT display
      * Simple door sign status update using web page - see html/msg.cgi and web/web.c for code
   * Network server client example for display updates
   * Uart network server client for serial uart to network bridge.
   * Generic queue handling code
   * Uart driver.
   * POSIX wrappers for FatFS - provides unix file I/O operations
    * Includes FatFS SD card support by ChaN
   * POSIX time functions and RTC set with NTP
   * Multiple timers used by rtc and time functions
   * HSPI code that can handle multiple devices each with varying clock frequencies
